- Make an introduction about how Moment team and community cares about security
- Setup two process: A) Public Report Way, Private Report Way
- If the vulnerability is not has no high damage impact you can report in the Public 
Report Way, by opening a Pull Request following a PR template
- If you think that this vulnerability has to be reported in a Private way, 
send an email to [provide here an email to private reports]
- Set a protocol about handling with private reports, that can include making it public to the community.
- Explain about how to report security bugs in third-party modules by using node security project
